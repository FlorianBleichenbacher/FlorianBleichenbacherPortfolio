# Indian life expectancy project

Welcome to my "Indian life expectancy" project. I've done this project as part of the "Springboard Intermediate Data Science" course. Please note that it was created entirely by myself and that the all decisions were made by me.

The goal of this project was to build a model which can be used to **predict the life expectancy of Indians**, and to make recommendations based on fulfilling that task. The client is a fictional Indian government agency aiming at increasing the average life expectancy in India. The client provided me with a database based on surveying members of the household of recently deceased Indians. 

I would recommend taking a look at the project in the same order as I've described each file below. If you don't have enough time for taking a look at all the files I'd recommend taking a look at the project report.

 - The most important part of the project is the [project report](https://github.com/FlorianBleichenbacher/FlorianBleichenbacherPortfolio/blob/master/IndianLifeExpectancyProject/ProjectReport.pdf). It describes the problem at hand in a more detailed fashion. Furthermore it describes which steps I've performed when creating this project and the three recommendations I've come up with.
 
 - First I had to do [data cleaning](https://github.com/FlorianBleichenbacher/FlorianBleichenbacherPortfolio/blob/master/IndianLifeExpectancyProject/Cleaning.ipynb).
 - Then, I've done some [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/FlorianBleichenbacher/FlorianBleichenbacherPortfolio/blob/master/IndianLifeExpectancyProject/EDA.ipynb).
 - Finally, I've used [Linear Regression](https://github.com/FlorianBleichenbacher/FlorianBleichenbacherPortfolio/blob/master/IndianLifeExpectancyProject/LinearRegression.ipynb) in order to make the prediction. *There is an 'experimental' linear regression part with added 'fictional' variables. (It's explained in detail in the project report). The cleaning and EDA steps for those additional variables are [here](https://github.com/FlorianBleichenbacher/FlorianBleichenbacherPortfolio/blob/master/IndianLifeExpectancyProject/more_data_experiment_preparation.ipynb). (It's basically a shortened version of the cleaning and EDA already done with the 'real' data.)*
 - I've created [presentation slides](https://github.com/FlorianBleichenbacher/FlorianBleichenbacherPortfolio/blob/master/IndianLifeExpectancyProject/ProjectSlides.pdf) I could use for presenting the project to the client for example.

Thank you for taking an interest in my project. In case you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at florian.bleichenbacher@gmx.ch.
